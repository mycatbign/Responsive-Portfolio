      <img id="Jbpic" src="assets/images/JBond_Image.jpg" style="float: left" alt="About Jeff Bond">
      <p>I grew up in the shadow of America's space program in Cocoa Beach Florida. Out of college I leveraged my
        mathematics degree to program with some really cool teams starting with real time work management solutions at
        Pam Am World Svcs on Kennedy Space Center supporting the space shuttle.</p>
      <p>Over the years, I've worked in several startup organizations GE's Tethered Aerostat in support of DEA and
        Corporate Facilities Management at Johnson Controls. My last two roles included working with successful startup
        Skillsoft in the training space and helping turn around Strategy Execution helping companies with Adaptive
        Leadership.</p>
      <p>My passion is building things and understanding how they work. I like engaging and working with people but
        enjoy quiet time with my wife Terri, children Anya and J.R. and two dogs Molly the Border Collie and Jack
        the Mutt. Originally from Florida we relocated over 15 years ago and love New England.</p>
      <p>I have a very entreprenurial spirit and these days I am really excited about getting back in to programming
        and especially Full Stack programming so I can support my own small business but also so I can help others with
        have ideas that could use some programming expertise.</p>
